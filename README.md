# Het-SBM
This project is providing fitting procedures for the Het-SBM model described in the thesis 'Generalised Stochastic Blockmodels and their Applications in the Analysis of Brain Networks' Chapter 4, Pavlovic 2015 (see the link to the paper https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/672071v1.abstract based on this chapetr). 
# Variables Specified by User
In this section, we give a list of variables supplied by a user. X is a 3-dimensional array which encodes adjacency matrices for each subject. The dimensions of X are nodes (n) by nodes (n) by subjects (K), where n stands for a total number of nodes in a network and K stands for a total number of subjects in the study. D is a 2-dimenisonal array (matrix) which encodes covariates of interest (i.e., design matrix). Design matrix D is given as subjects (K) by covariates (P).
